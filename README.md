# sveltekeleton

An opinionated SvelteKit boilerplate for shipping applications to Cloudflare
Workers. It distills the shared conventions from real, production-deployed
SvelteKit + Cloudflare apps into a fast, common starting point.

## Stack

- **SvelteKit 2** + **Svelte 5** (runes)
- **Vite 8** with the devtools-json plugin
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first, via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin) with **daisyUI** components
- **Superforms + Zod** for schema-driven forms and **Svelte Headless Table** for data grids
- **Cloudflare Workers** deployment via `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` + Wrangler
- **Cloudflare D1** database accessed through the **Kysely** ORM with code-based migrations
- **Cloudflare KV** for globally distributed caches, configuration, preferences, and session data
- **Internal authentication** with PBKDF2 password hashes and signed JWT cookies
- **TypeScript 6** in strict mode with `svelte-check`
- **Prettier** + **ESLint 10** (flat config) for formatting and linting
- **mise** for tool and task management (Node.js 26 + npm 12)

## Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) — pins Node.js and npm and runs all tasks.

Node.js and npm versions are declared in `mise.toml`. mise installs them
automatically on first use.

## Getting started

```sh
mise run init   # install mise tools and npm dependencies
mise run dev    # start the Vite dev server
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`. Startup applies pending local D1
migrations, clears every application table, and inserts useful development data.

## Debugging

Breakpoint configurations are committed in [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json).

### Visual Studio Code

Open **Run and Debug**, select `SvelteKit: VS Code breakpoints`, and press `F5`.
VS Code starts `mise run dev` in its JavaScript debug terminal, allowing
breakpoints in both client and server SvelteKit source.

### Google Chrome

In VS Code, select `SvelteKit: Chrome breakpoints` to start the
inspected development server and a separate Chrome debug profile. Set client
breakpoints in VS Code or Chrome DevTools source maps.

Outside VS Code, run:

```sh
mise run debug-chrome
```

Then open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome and select the dedicated Node DevTools
target. Open `http://localhost:5173` in Chrome to debug client source maps.

## Tasks

All tasks are run through mise, which delegates to the underlying npm scripts
defined in `package.json`.

| Task                        | Description                             |

## Environment variables

Only values that change between environments live in env vars. Copy the example
file and adjust:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable       | Purpose                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Canonical base URL (local dev vs production)                |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | Enables authentication when its normalized value is `true`  |
| `AUTH_SECRET`  | Server-only JWT signing secret containing at least 32 bytes |

Static app identity — title, description, author, keywords, and theme color —
lives in [`src/lib/site.ts`](src/lib/site.ts), not in env vars.

`AUTH_SECRET` is intentionally not prefixed with `APP_` and must never be
exposed to client code or committed with a production value. Authentication is
disabled when `AUTH_ENABLED` is absent or normalizes to `false`; an invalid
value or an enabled configuration without a sufficiently long secret fails
closed.

## Authentication

Authentication uses internal D1 users and username/password credentials. The
database stores only PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes with 600,000 iterations and a
unique 16-byte salt. Login failures use the same response whether the username
is missing or the password is wrong, and failed responses remove the submitted
password before returning form state to the browser.

Copying `.env.example` enables authentication locally. Development preseeding
creates this local-only account on every server start:

```text
username: developer
password: development-password
```

Never use that account or password in production. There is deliberately no
registration, password reset, user administration, or authorization model in
the skeleton; applications must add their own controlled user-provisioning
workflow.

### Protecting routes

Route groups make protection explicit without changing public URLs:

- Put browser pages under `src/routes/(protected)/`. Unauthenticated requests
  redirect to `/login` and preserve a safe local return path.
- Put server endpoints under `src/routes/(protected-api)/`. Unauthenticated
  requests receive `401 Authentication required`; `/api/session` is the included
  example.
- Keep routes outside those groups when they must remain public. `/login`,
  `/robots.txt`, and `/site.webmanifest` demonstrate public routes.

When authentication is disabled, both protected groups are accessible and
`locals.user` is `null`, so protected pages must tolerate the disabled mode.

Successful login creates an eight-hour HS256 JWT in an `HttpOnly`,
`SameSite=Lax` cookie. HTTPS requests also set `Secure`. Valid sessions are
renewed after half their lifetime during navigation, providing sliding
expiration. Logout is a POST operation that clears the cookie. JWT sessions are
stateless, so changing or deleting a database user does not revoke an already
issued token; rotate `AUTH_SECRET` to invalidate all sessions.

For production, set `AUTH_ENABLED=true` as a Worker variable and provision
`AUTH_SECRET` with Cloudflare Secrets using a cryptographically random value of
at least 32 bytes. Development preseeding always targets local bindings and
never creates production users.

PBKDF2 is deliberately expensive. Production deployments must apply
Cloudflare edge rate limiting to `POST /login` and configure a Worker CPU limit
that accommodates a measured password verification on the selected plan.

## Testing

`mise run test` runs three isolated Vitest suites:

- Node unit tests beside source modules as `*.test.ts`.
- Svelte component tests as `*.component.test.ts` using Testing Library and
  jsdom.
- Local D1 and KV integration tests under `tests/integration/` using Wrangler
  with persistence and remote bindings disabled.

The integration suite creates ephemeral local D1 and KV bindings and cannot
access production resources. The pre-commit hook runs the complete suite
together with formatting, linting, and type checks.

### Search engine visibility

Apps are **private by default**: `site.indexable` is `false`, which emits
`noindex,nofollow` and serves `Disallow: /` from `/robots.txt`. To make an app
public, flip the flag in `src/lib/site.ts`:

```ts
export const site = {
	// ...
	indexable: true,
} as const;
```

This single switch updates both the robots meta tag and the `robots.txt` route.

## Database (D1)

The skeleton ships with Cloudflare D1 support through the Kysely ORM, including
a migrations framework and the internal `users` table. Migrations are written
in TypeScript using Kysely's schema builder — never raw SQL.

The current `0001_initial` replaced the earlier disposable counter migration.
Existing local checkouts from that earlier revision must run `mise run db-reset`
once. It is now the baseline migration: do not rewrite it or any later applied
migration; add a new numbered migration instead.

### Local development

In `vite dev`, the `adapter-cloudflare` platform proxy exposes the D1 binding
(`event.platform.env.DB`) backed by a local SQLite database stored under
`.wrangler/`. Before Vite starts, the development command applies pending
migrations and replaces all application data with useful dummy records. The
preseed is intentionally destructive and runs on every development server
start, keeping the local database predictable without manual setup.

Migrations also run automatically on the first request after a server start as
a runtime safeguard. Concurrent requests in one Worker isolate share the same
initialization. A migration failure fails the request and is retried rather than
silently serving against a stale schema.

To run migrations explicitly against the local database (without starting the
dev server):

```sh
mise run db-migrate
```

To clear every application table and insert fresh development data manually:

```sh
mise run db-preseed
```

The preseed command applies pending migrations first, uses Kysely rather than
raw SQL, and always disables remote bindings. It recreates the local development
user documented above. Its implementation lives entirely under `scripts/`;
application code does not import it, so production builds and deployments
neither execute nor bundle development seed logic.

To wipe the local database and re-apply every migration from scratch (handy
during development):

```sh
mise run db-reset
```

This rolls all migrations back through their `down` methods and re-applies them,
so each migration must have a `down`; reset aborts before changing the database
if an irreversible migration is registered. All database scripts explicitly
disable remote bindings.

### Writing migrations

Add a new migration file in `src/lib/server/database/migrations/` using the
`NNNN_name.ts` convention, then register it in `migrations/index.ts`:

```ts
import type { Kysely } from "kysely";
import type { Migration } from "kysely/migration";

export const example: Migration = {
	async up(db: Kysely<any>): Promise<void> {
		await db.schema
			.createTable("example")
			.ifNotExists()
			.addColumn("id", "integer", (col) => col.primaryKey())
			.execute();
	},
};
```

The Kysely schema builder keeps every schema change type-checked and SQL-free.
Migrations are bundled into the Worker (no filesystem access at runtime), so
they also run on cold starts in production. D1 cannot provide transactions or
cross-isolate migration locks through this dialect, so every migration must be
safe to retry. Use `ifNotExists`, conflict handling, and equivalent idempotent
operations where needed.

The D1 dialect exposes only the table discovery required by Kysely migrations.
General Kysely schema introspection throws explicitly because Workers-bound D1
does not expose the PRAGMA metadata needed to return correct column details.

### Production

Before deploying, create a real D1 database and set its id in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```sh
mise exec -- npx wrangler d1 create sveltekeleton   # copy the printed database_id
```

Replace the `database_id` placeholder in `wrangler.jsonc`, then `mise run deploy`.
Migrations are applied automatically on the first request after each deploy.

## Key-value storage (KV)

The `KV` binding is exposed by Wrangler as `event.platform.env.KV`. The server
hook wraps it as a namespaced JSON store at `event.locals.kv`, so routes and
server modules share serialization and key conventions instead of calling the
raw binding directly:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const sessionSchema = z.object({ userId: z.string() });
const stored = await locals.kv?.get<unknown>(`sessions:v1:${token}`);
const parsed = sessionSchema.safeParse(stored);
const session = parsed.success ? parsed.data : null;
await locals.kv?.put(`sessions:v1:${token}`, { userId }, { expirationTtl: 3600 });
await locals.kv?.delete(`sessions:v1:${token}`);
```

The wrapper adds the `app:` prefix. Callers must add a domain and version,
such as `sessions:v1:` or `cache:v1:`, and use expiration for temporary values.
KV has no schema migrations; evolve key formats by introducing a new versioned
prefix and deleting old keys when they are no longer needed.

### Local development

The adapter-cloudflare platform proxy provides a local KV implementation during
`mise run dev`. Values persist under `.wrangler/` and never touch production KV,
so the placeholder namespace id in `wrangler.jsonc` is enough for development.
The starter page demonstrates this with a five-minute cache entry: the first
request reports a miss and later requests report a hit.

Clear local cached values without changing other local KV domains with:

```sh
mise run cache-reset
```

This deletes every key under the application cache prefix (`app:cache:`) from
the local Wrangler binding only. It preserves non-cache keys such as preferences
and never enables remote bindings.

### Consistency and sessions

Workers KV is optimized for read-heavy workloads and is eventually consistent.
Writes, updates, and deletes may take 60 seconds or more to become visible in
other locations. It is appropriate for caches, configuration, preferences,
allow-lists, and expiring session records when delayed invalidation is
acceptable. Do not use KV for counters, locks, transactions, write-heavy data,
or security flows that require immediate global revocation; use D1 or another
coordination mechanism instead. Session identifiers must be high-entropy,
stored only in secure cookies, and paired with explicit KV expiration.

### Production

Create the production namespace before deployment:

```sh
mise exec -- npx wrangler kv namespace create KV   # copy the printed id
```

Replace the KV `id` placeholder in `wrangler.jsonc`. Deployment requires both
the real D1 database id and KV namespace id.

## Logging

Structured logs are emitted in [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) — `key=value`
pairs with the message first — and are written to the console, so they appear in
the Vite dev terminal and in Cloudflare logs (`wrangler tail` / Workers
observability).

```
msg="GET /" level=info ts=2026-08-03T16:39:55.000Z method=GET path=/ status=200 duration_ms=15
```

Access logging is built into `hooks.server.ts`: every request logs its method,
path, status, and duration, with the level rising to `warn` (4xx) and `error`
(5xx). Internal events (e.g. migrations) are logged the same way.

Use the logger from any server module:

```ts
import { logger } from "$lib/server/logger";

logger.info("user created", { id: 42 });
logger.error("payment failed", { reason: "insufficient_funds" });
```

Levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`. `debug` is only shown in
development; `info` and above are shown everywhere.

## Customizing for a new application

1. Update `name` and `version` in `package.json` and `wrangler.jsonc`.
2. Edit `src/lib/site.ts` to set the app metadata, web manifest settings, and
   whether it should be `indexable`.
3. Rename the `APP_` env prefix everywhere if a project-specific prefix is
   preferred (`svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, `.env.example`, and
   `$env/static/public` references in routes).
4. Replace `static/favicon.svg`.

## Deployment

Deployment targets Cloudflare Workers via Wrangler. Authenticate with
`npx wrangler login` once, then:

```sh
mise run deploy
```
